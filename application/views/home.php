          <h2>Simple feedback tools</h2>
          <p>BugSharkâ€™s markup tools allow Sharks to visually communicate the bugs found on your website to your developers, UX team, and content editors. Interactive drawing and text tools, with a snapshot of the markup, save your team from decoding bug reports, sifting through countless feedback emails, and the frustration of re-creating reported bugs.</p>

          <h2>Quality Assurance</h2>
          <p>BugShark allows you to utilize a crowdsourced team of experts or enable your internal testing partners to find bugs fast and provide accurate bug reports. To incentivize the Sharks we allow website owners to offer a bounty for a set period of time for the pool of Sharks to find a variety of bugs. Bug severity determines the payout to the individual or group of Sharks.</p>

          <h2>Cross Browser Capability</h2>
          <p>No single browser contains all your bugs, so why should BugShark be limited? BugShark works in all major browsers.</p>

          <h2>Sharks</h2>
          <p>Our unique community of crowdsourced Sharks are able to build their reputation and earn a portion of the bounty. This keeps them incentivized to come back for more.</p>

          <h2>Simple feedback tools</h2>
          <p>Bug Sharkâ€™s markup tools allow Sharks (experts) to visually communicate the bugs found on your website to your developers, UX team, and content editors. Interactive drawing & text tools save your team from decoding bug reports, sifting through countless feedback emails, and the frustration of re-creating reported bugs.</p>

          <h2>Crowdsource Quality Assurance</h2>

In exchange, website owners offer a flat fee for a set period of time for the pool of Sharks to find a variety of bugs. Bug severity determines the payout to the individual or group of Sharks.</p>
